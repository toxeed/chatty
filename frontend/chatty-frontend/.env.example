# API Base URL for production deployment
# Set this to your Render backend URL (without trailing slash)
# Example: https://chatty-backend.onrender.com/api
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080/api

# WebSocket URL is automatically derived from API_BASE_URL:
# - /api is stripped from the URL
# - /ws is appended
# - http:// becomes ws:// and https:// becomes wss://
# Example: http://localhost:8080/api -> ws://localhost:8080/ws
